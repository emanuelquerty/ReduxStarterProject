# ReduxStarterApp

A simple redux starter application with vanilla JavaScript that can be used
for quickly setting up redux in any application, whether it is a vanilla JavaScript app,
react.js or any other app built with a frontend framework;

### Usage

Import the redux store from store.js to any file where you want to start using redux as you
as you would if you were to set up redux from start and adjust the initial state as needed

### Notes

The app has additional code for the application that was built with this starter project.
Feel free to delete any file except the ones in ./src and adjust the starter project as needed.
